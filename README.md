# Test01
Test for longest palindromic substring in a string of numerical characters using CLI.

Startby navigating to the directory containing "main.py" in a command line interface.
Enter "python main.py" to run the application.
Input the string in the empty line below and press the "enter" or "return" key.
If a palendrome exists in the string, the longest palendrome will be output to the next line.
The output will appear behind the promt as a result of using stdout instead of the print function.

The instructions of the test call for a CLI application that uses input as stdin and stout.
As means of input and output.

The maximum input is a character lenth of 1,000,000.
Only numeric characters 0-9 are permitted.
* Note: The test instuctions have it listed as "1,000,0001,000,000", I am unsure if this is a typo.
  
The application will search for the longest palendromic substring within the input string.
When finished, the application will return the longest palendromic substring in the next line behind the promt.
